Requires at least: 2.8.4
Tested up to: 2.8.4
Stable tag: trunk

Special dynamiccally designed category-links in special places.

== Description ==

You can select special categories and customize colors of how you want them to look, then select where you want them placed(after user name, after time, after tags or instead of categories)
 <br/>
The Whole idea is to place certain categories like BREAKING NEWS or FEATURED ARTICLE somewhere in your post so that people will see the category and click on it to see other "breaking news" posts.
<br/>
<b>You can</b>:
- Select text color<br/>
- Select border color<br/>
- Select background color<br/>
- Configure CSS on featureak links<br/>
- Choose where they will appear(after user name, after time, after tags or instead of categories)<br/>
- Select up to 100 categories to show (i'd thought i'd give it a big number.. just in case)<br/>
